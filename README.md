## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailWindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Tailwind is awesome.
My only problem with it is the long list of classnames which what repelled me initially but I have found a temp solution for it which is [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=moalamri.inline-fold) VS code extension that folds the classnames.

### Useful resources
